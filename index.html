        <h2 class="card-title">Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring front-end developer who loves to learn everything about the web.
          In the 6 years that I have been professionally working, I always have this desire
          to learn more than what I have learned so far, that I know there is more
          for me than what I have achieved. And that's how I discovered my passion to learn more about the
          world of the web.</p>
        <p>I've experienced living in 3 states but I am here in California the longest. What I love about living here
          is I can go swimming in the beaches during summer, go snowboarding in the mountains during winter,
           and there is a lot of good food around!</p>
        <p>I have worked in different jobs at the hospitality industry. Currently, I am a professional cook 
          and had experienced working as a food server.</p>
        <p>In my journey towards life-long learning as a front-end developer, I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process 
          of building fantastic looking websites.</p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2 class="card-title">Goals</h2>
        <p>In my journey as a front-end developer, I want to master the process of building easy to use web sites 
          and expand my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>React</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d love to work for a company where I can grow as a developer, professionally and personally, 
          contribute to their success and that helps clients create an impressive online presence.</p>
